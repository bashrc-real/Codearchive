This slide is basically aimed at professionals and students to introduce them with functional programming.  
I haven't used much functional programming terminologies because I personally feel they could be overwhelming
to people getting introduced to FP for the first time. 
For similar reasons I have deliberately avoided using any functional programming language and kept the discussions 
programming language agnostic as far as possible.
